Builder
-------

The builder gem/library is required to render builder templates:

```ruby
## You'll need to require builder in your app
require 'builder'

get '/' do
  builder :index
end
```

This will render ./views/index.builder

```ruby
get '/' do
  builder do |xml|
    xml.node do
      xml.subnode "Inner text"
    end
  end
end
```

This will render the xml inline, directly from the handler.
